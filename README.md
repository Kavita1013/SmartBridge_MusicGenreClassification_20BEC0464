##  Project title: A Machine Learning-based system for music genre classification using Spotify data

A machine learning-based system for music genre classification using Spotify data is a system that uses machine learning algorithms to automatically categorize music tracks into different genres based on the audio features extracted from Spotify's music data. By training models on labeled data, the system learns patterns and characteristics associated with various genres. Once trained, the system can classify new, unlabeled tracks into their respective genres. This system enables automated and efficient music genre classification, benefiting music enthusiasts, streaming platforms, and industry professionals in tasks such as music recommendation, playlist generation, and music discovery.
